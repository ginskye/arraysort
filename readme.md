Group Autocomplete project, in Ruby<p>
Our spec file includes tests for how the autocomplete should work, which helped to structure the base code<p>
Autocomplete exists as a class which contains the dictionary array<p>
Currently the autocomplete.rb program only works within the context of the ruby spec tests<p>

Future: Use this framework to write a console program around it to incorporate new words and suggestions<p>
